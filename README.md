# SecureLogin
Login system using CutomTKInter and SQLite3

**Learning CustomTKinter & SQLite3 in Python**

This program uses both client and server functionality. Username and passwords are required to login to the system. Passwords are hashed using Hashlib.
Queries to the database are done via parameterized SQL-query to avoid SQL Injection.

Program is very barebones and is the foundation to a better system down the road with development
