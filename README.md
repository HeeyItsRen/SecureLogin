# SecureLogin
Login system using CutomTKInter and SQLite3

**Learning CustomTKinter & SQLite3 in Python**

This program uses both client and server functionality. Username and passwords are required to login to the system. Passwords are hashed using Hashlib.
Queries to the database are done via parameterized SQL-query to avoid SQL Injection.

Program is very barebones and is the foundation to a better system down the road with development

## How to run

Please download the zip to any location (Just remember where you downloaded it to)

Extract the files

Open up command prompt or your choice of commandline interface (CLI) and type 
```
python -m pip install customtkinter
```
Once CustomTKinter has been installed

You may run first the server.py
```
py server.py
```
Then run the main.py
```
main.py
```

That's all!
